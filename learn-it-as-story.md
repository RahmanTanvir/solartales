At the end of each lesson page, add a “Learn It As Story” section that turns that topic into a short, engaging narrative. Here’s a template you can slot in:

📖 Learn It As Story
“Imagine you’re an interplanetary reporter aboard the Solar Observer spacecraft, hurtling toward Earth through a storm of charged particles. As you approach, your instruments—just like the ones you learned about—flash warnings of an incoming [Topic Name]. You remember how

[Key Term 1] described…

[Key Term 2] explained…

Recalling today’s lesson on [Topic Name], you mentally map the Sun’s activity (or Earth’s magnetic field, or CME trajectory, etc.), then guide mission control through your next steps:

You deploy the [Activity Tool or Concept] to…

You interpret the [Data or Phenomenon] to forecast what happens next…

You share your report with scientists on Earth, who use your story-derived insights to…

By weaving factual concepts into a first-person adventure—complete with characters, conflict, and resolution—learners both reinforce the science and experience the excitement of real space weather work.”

Place this narrative immediately after the Activities section so students see how their knowledge becomes a story-driven mission.
