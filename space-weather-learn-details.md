Key Terms

Solar cycle

Magnetic field line

Solar maximum / solar minimum

Solar storm

Lesson Narrative
The Sun is not a static ball of heat—deep within its core, hydrogen nuclei fuse into helium, releasing immense energy in a process called nuclear fusion. This fusion powers sunlight and heat that sustain life on Earth.

Every 11 years, the Sun goes through a solar cycle marked by fluctuating numbers of sunspots—dark patches on the surface where intense magnetic fields suppress convection. At solar maximum, sunspots and solar storms (including flares and coronal mass ejections) peak; at solar minimum, the Sun’s surface appears much quieter.

Sunspots form where the Sun’s magnetic field lines twist and poke out of the surface, creating cooler regions that look dark against the bright photosphere. When these twisted fields snap and reconnect, they can unleash powerful solar storms that send high-energy particles and radiation into space—sometimes all the way to Earth.

Understanding our dynamic Sun—and its ever-changing magnetic personality—is the first step toward predicting space weather and protecting our modern technology.

Lesson 2: Solar Flares – The Sun’s Explosive Outbursts
Level: Intermediate
Duration: 25 minutes
Mode: Data Analysis

Learning Objectives
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

Describe the process of magnetic reconnection that triggers solar flares.

Classify flares into C-, M-, and X-classes by X-ray intensity.

Explain how solar flares disrupt Earth’s ionosphere and radio communications.

Key Terms
Magnetic reconnection

Solar flare

GOES X-ray flux

C-class, M-class, X-class

Ionosphere

Radio blackout (R-class)

Lesson Narrative
Solar flares occur when twisted magnetic field lines in the Sun’s atmosphere suddenly realign in a process called magnetic reconnection. This releases energy equivalent to millions of hydrogen bombs in mere minutes, accelerating particles and producing bursts of X-rays and ultraviolet light.

Flares are classified by peak X-ray flux measured by the GOES satellites: C-class flares are common and minor; M-class flares can cause short-lived radio blackouts; and X-class flares are rare, powerful events that can significantly disrupt communications on Earth.

When a flare’s high-energy photons hit Earth’s ionosphere, they increase ionization levels, causing radio signals (especially HF) to absorb or scatter—leading to R- class radio blackouts. Understanding flare classification helps forecasters warn pilots, mariners, and power-grid operators to take protective measures.

Lesson Narrative
Coronal mass ejections are massive eruptions of solar plasma and magnetic field released from the Sun’s corona. Unlike flares, which emit radiation, CMEs hurl billions of tons of charged particles into space at speeds up to 3 000 km/s.

When a CME is Earth-directed, it can take 1–4 days to arrive, depending on speed. Upon impact, the CME’s magnetic field can merge with Earth’s magnetosphere, initiating a geomagnetic storm measured by indices like Kp (planetary) and Dst (equatorial ring current strength).

Understanding CME properties and transit times is crucial for forecasting potential disruptions to satellites, power grids, and communication networks.

Key Terms

Lesson Narrative
Earth’s magnetic field arises from convective motions in its liquid iron core, creating a dynamo effect. This field extends into space, forming the magnetosphere, which acts as a protective bubble against harmful solar particles. Solar wind pressure shapes a bow shock and magnetopause boundary on the dayside and a long magnetotail on the nightside.

Within this magnetic cocoon lie the Van Allen radiation belts, doughnut-shaped zones where charged particles spiral along field lines. During geomagnetic storms, enhanced solar wind pressure and southward interplanetary magnetic fields compress the magnetosphere, causing energetic particles to penetrate deeper, which can harm satellites and astronauts.

Understanding the structure and dynamics of Earth’s magnetic shield is essential for predicting space weather impacts on our technology and infrastructure.

Lesson Narrative
Solar wind streams carry charged particles that spiral along Earth’s magnetic field lines and collide with atmospheric atoms and molecules, exciting them to higher energy states. When these atoms return to their ground states, they emit photons—visible as the aurora, predominantly green from oxygen at ~100-300 km altitude, red from higher oxygen, and purple/blue from nitrogen.

Auroras appear in oval rings around the geomagnetic poles. During intense geomagnetic storms, these ovals expand toward lower latitudes, making auroras visible much farther from the poles. Studying auroral displays provides insight into solar-magnetosphere interactions.
